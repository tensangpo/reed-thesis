## My Thesis Repo

The structure of this repository should serve as a starting point in organizing all of the work related to your thesis.

#### literature-review folder

It is very helpful to organize high-level thoughts on the articles and books that you read as part of your literature review. This could take the form of a markdown document or a spreadsheet. As you read a new work, add an entry to your file that notes things such as a) citation (broken into author, title, year) b) very brief summary c) how does this (if at all) relate to my thesis? Note that you probably should not add actual pdfs of articles here as it may violate copyright.

#### thesis folder

This is were all of the files related to your final thesis should live. I recommend that you start by adding a template to this directory - either the Markdown thesis template or the LaTeX thesis template.

#### research-log

It important to keep regular notes on your work so that you can mine it later on as you compose your final thesis. Aim to add a markdown file to this folder every week with the work that you've done. You can use this as a sketch book, a thought diary, or a place to actually formally do analysis/writing that you'll copy/paste into your thesis.

#### README.md

The README.md file is the one that contains the text that you're reading right now. It serves as a landing file for when people access your repository on github. You should delete the above instructions and replace them with an abstract, timeline, and outline of our thesis.

To get your timeline started, please propose dates for the major milestones of the thesis:

1. literature review done:  9/14/2019
