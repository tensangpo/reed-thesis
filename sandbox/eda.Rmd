The NSRDB 1991–2005 update is a serially complete collection of hourly values of the three most common measurements of solar radiation (i.e., global horizontal, direct normal, and diffuse horizontal) over a period of time adequate to establish means and extremes and at a sufficient number or locations to represent regional solar radiation climates. Nearly all of the solar data in the NSRDB are modeled, and only 40 sites have measured solar data — none of them with a complete period of record.


The manual for this data set can be obtained from the following extension:
