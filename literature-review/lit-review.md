- **Author:**M.S. Wheatland 
- **Year:**2004
- **Title:**A Bayesian Approach to Solar Flare Prediction
- **Summary:**
A review of the author's Bayesian approach to predict flares (posterior) using flaring record of an active region. 
- **How does this relate?**
A brief introduction to solar physics regarding flare prediction. 
Specifically the power-law for the flare size distribution and the waiting time distribution. 
These aren't very accurate but will function as our priors. 
Along with the flaring data of an active region delivers the posterior.
